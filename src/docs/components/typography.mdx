# Typography

The Typography component is used to present your content in clear hierarchical structure and consistent styling.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Typography } from "@/components/Typography/Typography";

export default function TypographyDemo() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Typography variant="h1">The Quick Brown Fox</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h2">The Quick Brown Fox</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h3">The Quick Brown Fox</Typography>
      <Typography variant="p">
        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a paragraph of text
        that demonstrates the typography component's default text styling.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="blockquote">
        "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="lead">
        A lead paragraph that stands out from regular text.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="large">Larger than normal text</Typography>
      <Typography variant="small">Smaller text for less emphasis</Typography>
      <Typography variant="muted">
        Muted text for secondary information
      </Typography>
    </div>

### All Variants

  <Typography variant="h2">Heading 2</Typography>
  <Typography variant="h3">Heading 3</Typography>
  <Typography variant="h4">Heading 4</Typography>

  <Typography variant="h6">Heading 6</Typography>

  <Typography variant="p">

  </Typography>

  <Typography variant="blockquote">
    "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it
    works." - Steve Jobs
  </Typography>

  <Typography variant="lead">
    This is a lead paragraph that introduces an important section of content.
  </Typography>

  <Typography variant="large">
    This text is larger than normal for emphasis
  </Typography>

  <Typography variant="small">
    This is smaller text, perfect for captions or supporting text
  </Typography>

  <Typography variant="muted">
    This is muted text, ideal for secondary information or metadata
  </Typography>
</div>
```

### Custom Element Type

You can override the default HTML element using the `as` prop:

```tsx
<Typography variant="h1" as="div">
  This is styled like an h1 but rendered as a div
</Typography>
```

### Custom Styling

The Typography component accepts custom classes through the `className` prop:

```tsx
<Typography
  variant="h1"
  className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 transition-colors"
>
  Custom styled heading
</Typography>
```

## Accessibility

- Use heading levels (`h1`-`h6`) in a logical order that reflects the document structure
- Don't skip heading levels - this helps screen reader users understand your content hierarchy
- Use semantic HTML elements when possible (e.g., `<blockquote>` for quotes)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text variants
- Consider using `lead` variant for introductory paragraphs to provide better context

## Best Practices

1. Document Structure

   - Use `h1` for the main page title
   - Use `h2` for major sections
   - Use `h3`-`h6` for subsections
   - Use `p` for regular paragraphs

2. Content Hierarchy

   - Use `lead` for introductory text
   - Use `muted` for supplementary information
   - Use `small` for metadata or supporting text
   - Use `large` sparingly for emphasis

3. Styling
   - Avoid overriding the base styles unless necessary
   - Use the built-in dark mode support
   - Maintain consistent spacing between typography elements
   - Use the className prop for minor style adjustments
